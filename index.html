    <h3 id="about-me-p"> Hi! I'm Jaden. I love love love to write, travel, learn and of course, code! I'm just gonna put a TON of filler text in here because I wantthis paragraph to be long but I also don't feel like talking about myself so yeah. If you've read this far, buckle up. Uhmmmmmmm. Yeah. So. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you tossed a french fry out of an airplane ? Like, some dude would get hit in the head with a french fry and be like "wtf?!" Then, he would bring the story to his local news station and they'd be like "haha nah dude." He would live his life without anyone believing that an extraterrestrial fried potato hit him on the head one day. OMG I just realized I wrote the plot of Chicken Little. Disney hit me up. Let's make a sequel. </h3>
